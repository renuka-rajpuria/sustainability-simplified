### Question(s) asked:

What is the USP? Why should people come to this particular website instead of the other options? 
-> Highlight the benefits of sustainable websites from business perspective and give an under the roof information.

-> Future prospects include offering visitors not only an analysis of carbon-emissions of the website but also giving them all the required resources.

-> For example - image compression, minifying the scripts options available on the website itself.

-> Another suggestion is to niche down and focus on few target audience.

-> Green websites could be awarded with badge (For reference see clevercarbon's badge by greenpixie) - emphasise its importance in building customer trust.

### Competitor Analysis:

The other problem statements discussed on the session focused on better/ free storage options and others with municipal complaints directory. Some also focused on supply-chain management.

### Submissions/ Others:

-> The presentation was shared during review call.

-> The problem statement was shared as follows - 

The internet consumes approximately 416 TWh per year of energy and a majority of that is contributed by the websites we surf. The massive internet usage may suggest a greener society as we are saving paper but the carbon footprint and e-waste generated by these electronic devices is far more worse. Building a sustainable website does not require compromising with any of its features, rather improves them. Awareness and education regarding the same is a primary concern. 


-> The initial solution was shared as follows - 

A sustainable solution that calculates the carbon emissions attributed to a website. It will not only raise awareness but also inspire a more sustainable internet. Many global companies like Cisco, Google, Adobe have already realized the importance of green websites and are continuously working toward carbon-neutral approaches. I wish to highlight the several benefits of building sustainable websites such as better user experience, reduced network latency, increased conversion rates and others. I strongly believe that we can achieve not only carbon neutral but carbon negative results if users and developers are motivated and convinced from a commercial stand point to create greener websites.

-> Note that Cisco plans to achieve its carbon-neutral goals by 2040.

-> Future prospects could also include a chrome extension.
